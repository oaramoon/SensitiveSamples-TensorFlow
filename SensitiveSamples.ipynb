    "\n",
    "<font size=\"3\"> Numerous cloud-based services are provided to help customers develop and deploy deep learning applications. When a customer deploys a deep learning model in the cloud and serves it to end-users, it is important to be able to verify that the deployed model has not been tampered with. In paper (https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/html/He_Sensitive-Sample_Fingerprinting_of_Deep_Neural_Networks_CVPR_2019_paper.html), the authors propose a novel and practical methodology to verify the integrity of remote deep learning models, with only black-box access to the target models. Specifically, they introduce Sensitive-Sample fingerprints, which are a small set of human unnoticeable transformed inputs that make the model outputs sensitive to the model's parameters. Even small model changes can be clearly reflected in the model outputs. In this notebook, we generate sensitive samples for a ResNet-20 model trained on CIFAR-10 dataset.<font/>"
